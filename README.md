# Canonical Take-Home Test

[![npm 10.2.4](src\assets\npm-version.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This is a project built to fulfill an assessment from Canonical, to replicate [this design](src/assets/sample-cards.png) using the [Vanilla framework](https://vanillaframework.io/docs). This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2 and **npm version 10.2.4**.

## Setup

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```

The `npm run start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application, watches for changes to the source files, and runs a dev server on `http://localhost:4200/`.

Press `q + enter` to shut it down.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
